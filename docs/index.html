    <h1>Racko, Code Annotation with Racket</h1>

    <p>Racko is a code annotation tool that reads source files and
      generates annotation files with single-line comments presented
      alongside the source code.</p>

    <p>Racko supports annotation generation and some basic syntax
      highlighting. There are no external dependencies, so it is very
      small and easy to use. Simply download Racko from Racket's packaging
      tool <code>raco</code></p>

    <p>Examples:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sleibrock.xyz/racko/parser.rkt.html">Racko source code annotated</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
