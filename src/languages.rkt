Racko supported languages and other data in here

The lexer has to be improved upon because multiple groups will overlap
and cause coloring issues when smaller words are found in larger words.
Either keep it simple keywords, or come up with a new lexer idea that
works in most (if not all) cases and is easy to use to parse other
languages and color them accordingly.
